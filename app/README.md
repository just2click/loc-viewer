Library of Congress Image Viewer sample

This is a Backbone Single Page Web Application Sample

It uses the Library of Congress to enable the user to search for images.

Since it's a sample application it will only show up to 20 images per search

No data of the search it saved, neither locally, nor or any server.

This application also uses Bootstrap for CSS styling and Masonry for image positioning

Searches may be passed into the browser address bar so users may send searches as links

Future enhancements:

* Add some application settings
* Save last searches and use them for search auto complete
* Enable switching images display into an image gallery style
